# 🧾 Fake Payment Screenshot Detector  
### Detecting Digital Payment Fraud with AI and Image Forensics

## 🔍 Overview

The **Fake Payment Screenshot Detector** is an AI-powered web-based tool designed to identify forged or tampered payment transaction screenshots. It uses image forensics, machine learning, and metadata analysis to verify the authenticity of payment proof images submitted during transactions.

Whether you're a business, freelancer, or platform that accepts digital payments, this tool helps protect against scams involving **edited screenshots** from apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or bank portals.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Image Forensics (ELA & Edge Detection)**  
  Detects manipulations using Error Level Analysis (ELA), edge inconsistencies, and compression anomalies.

- 🧠 **AI-Based Classification**  
  Trained ML model distinguishes between real and fake transaction images with high accuracy.

- 🕵️ **OCR Verification**  
  Extracts text using Tesseract OCR to check if the content (like transaction ID, amount, etc.) matches expected patterns.

- 📸 **Metadata Analysis**  
  Examines image EXIF data to determine the source (camera, WhatsApp, screenshots, etc.).

- 🖼️ **Image Preview + Drag & Drop UI**  
  Users can preview uploaded images with a clean, responsive drag-and-drop interface.

- 📄 **PDF Report Generation**  
  Generates downloadable forensic reports summarizing the analysis results.

- 🌓 **Dark Mode Support**  
  Fully styled for light and dark themes to enhance usability.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User uploads a payment screenshot**
2. **Backend processes the image**:
   - Performs ELA & Edge Detection
   - Extracts text using OCR
   - Checks metadata for social media signs (e.g. WhatsApp compression)
   - Uses an AI model to classify authenticity
3. **Results are displayed** with visual evidence
4. **PDF report** is generated and optionally sent via email
